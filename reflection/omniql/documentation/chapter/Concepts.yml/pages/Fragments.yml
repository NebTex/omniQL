    Fragments in omniql are some of the most powerfull tools for compose queries and consume them

    how does frameng works

    First thanks to the strong and stricly typed nature of omnibuf and many of its restrictions, is posible to represent each result of any query one tree,
    even before the query is execute, fragments exploit this feature, giving to the programer the abability to tell to backend which  part of that tree they want it return

    example

    ```omniqlExamples.FragmentRecord(io.omniql.examples.houseMarketv1)
    GetCheapHauses(limit:10).SetFragment(

    )

    ```
    # typed fragments
