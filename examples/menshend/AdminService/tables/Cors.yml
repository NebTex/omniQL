        AllowedOrigins is a list of origins a cross-domain request can be executed from.
        If the special "*" value is present in the list, all origins will be allowed.
        An origin may contain a wildcard (*) to replace 0 or more characters
        (i.e.: http://*.domain.com). Usage of wildcards implies a small performance penality.
        Only one wildcard can be used per origin.
